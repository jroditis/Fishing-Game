You know gachapon games? See, fishing is nature's gachapon. 
Catch fish; sometimes you can even catch rare ones. 
That's it.
Well... I actually did want to use this as base code for a parody game idea my friends and I have been developing for years now; it's fundamentally still a digital gachapon, probably with minigames for more difficult catches and a visual novel element added for corresponding story. 
...But it's still fishing. 
I'll maybe come back to this eventually! I still like the idea of developing a small game; it's just completely out of my scope at the moment.
